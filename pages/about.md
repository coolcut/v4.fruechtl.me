Besides my day work, I also consult small and medium businesses on design and web problems. Additionally, I work on different side projects.

At Clark, which is a digital insurance broker available on the [Web](https://www.clark.de/de/) as well as [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.clark.app) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/der-versicherungsmanager/id1054790721?mt=8), I work on all our different consumer-facing product as well as the Whitelabel business.

In my spare time, I also work on different passion and open source projects. These projects differ in size, audience and time investment and include things like podcast production, contribution to an open source podcast player, development of iOS applications or possible product ideas I work on with friends. The thing I enjoy the most about these different challenges and opportunities is the diversity of problems that occur during the life-span of such projects. These activities keep me energized, help me grow and uncover unknown view-points to different problems.

### Elsewhere

Personally, I love almost nothing as much as a good conversation or discussions about an exciting topic. If you'd like to talk to me about a specific subject or nearly anything, feel free to [email](mailto:jan@fruechtl.me) me.

You can also find me on different popular social media platforms. Sometimes I share my thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_coolcut), preferably [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@coolcut) or post visual content on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/coolcut).

I also love the open web and blogging, so you can also visit [my own little blog](https://coolcut.xyz) and ditch all these social media platforms.
