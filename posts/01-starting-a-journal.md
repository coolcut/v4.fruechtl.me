As of today, I'm trying something new. I want to take notes, share some interesting articles I read, write down some random thoughts and everything about this is happening online on my personal website. The content is going to be heavily influenced by my professional directions in the future and will probably be focused around design.

I've tried something like this earlier but it never really stuck. I don't really know why it should be any different this time, but I wanna try it anyway. The basic idea of this journal comes from the fantastic journal from [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com/journal), and I want to go in a similar direction.
