Text: The [Podlove Web Player](https://podlove.org/podlove-web-player/) is an optimized open-source podcast player based on [Vue](https://vuejs.org). In mid-2018, I joined the team and started contributing concepts and visual design to improve the experience of this player. The first release I've supported with ideas and designs was the redesign of the file tab. Shortly after that, I contributed some tweaks to the audio tab.
