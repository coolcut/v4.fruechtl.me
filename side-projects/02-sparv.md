Sparv was a web service with the goal of making the lives for personal trainers and their clients more comfortable. Together with a friend, we focused on building an early prototype that tried to solve the needs of personal trainers. We developed the first version in [Node](https://nodejs.org) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org). Because of some changes in both our lives, we stopped the project in early 2018 and open-sourced the current status of this project.
